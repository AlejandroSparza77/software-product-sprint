          Hello! My name is Sergio Alejandro Esparza Gonz√°lez. I am from Mexico
          and I am currently studying a B.S. in Computer Science and Technology
          at ITESM.
      </p>
      <p>
          I was born in Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Mexico on 09/21 twenty
          years ago.
      </p> 
      <p>
          I learned to use a computer since I was a child. My dad had a Windows
          98 PC that I was able to learn on (a bit old even for those days).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I was a child I was interested in mathematics, I had more
        advanced knowledge than my schoolmates in it, of course I also had
        computers, because unfortunately the teachers did not even let us use
        them to do homework, until I entered high school (and only little by 
        little).
      </p>
      <p>
        I've played video games since I was little, I went from having an NES
        (also my dad's) to having a Wii (now mine), and then I had an Xbox One,
        but I've always played on PC anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        In middle school, my grades started to drop, because I was only focused
        on learning what I liked, so I started to focus almost entirely on
        school until I finished high school. This brought me many advantages,
        such as being the highest average of my generation, but it brought me
        disadvantages, such as not learning those things that I was passionate
        about (for example, I started programming shortly before entering
        university). Currently, I have tried to find a balance between the
        things I love and school, as proof of that I am here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also really like music, so much so that I play piano, guitar,
        recorder and I also sing; Similarly, I consider sports an important
        part of my life, since throughout my life I have practiced soccer,
        tae-kwon-do, swimming and basketball, in addition to training
        calisthenics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects I have worked on: ITESM academic excellence mentor, network
        connection of a Retail Store with Velatia, design of a traffic
        simulator with AppWorld, digital animator with ANSPAC, management of
        the MAESTEC advisory database, Google SPS participant.
