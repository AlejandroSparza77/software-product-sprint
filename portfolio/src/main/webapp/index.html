      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>
          Hello! My name is Sergio Alejandro Esparza González. I am from Mexico
          and I am currently studying a B.S. in Computer Science and Technology
          at ITESM.
      </p>
      <p>
          I was born in Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Mexico on 09/21 twenty
          years ago.
      </p> 
      <p>
          I learned to use a computer since I was a child. My dad had a Windows
          98 PC that I was able to learn on (a bit old even for those days).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I was a child I was interested in mathematics, I had more
        advanced knowledge than my schoolmates in it, of course I also had
        computers, because unfortunately the teachers did not even let us use
        them to do homework, until I entered high school (and only little by 
        little).
      </p>
      <p>
        I've played video games since I was little, I went from having an NES
        (also my dad's) to having a Wii (now mine), and then I had an Xbox One,
        but I've always played on PC anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        In middle school, my grades started to drop, because I was only focused
        on learning what I liked, so I started to focus almost entirely on
        school until I finished high school. This brought me many advantages,
        such as being the highest average of my generation, but it brought me
        disadvantages, such as not learning those things that I was passionate
        about (for example, I started programming shortly before entering
        university). Currently, I have tried to find a balance between the
        things I love and school, as proof of that I am here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also really like music, so much so that I play piano, guitar,
        recorder and I also sing; Similarly, I consider sports an important
        part of my life, since throughout my life I have practiced soccer,
        tae-kwon-do, swimming and basketball, in addition to training
        calisthenics.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy photographing exotic animals such as peacocks and deer as
        there are many close to my home. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, I like to shoot crazy weather like heavy rain, storms and
        sunsets (in my hometown they get really beautiful).
      </p>

        I also like to photograph musical events that I attend, such as an
        orchestra playing a symphony.

      <h2>My Hidden Talent</h2>
      <img src="/images/Actors.jpg" />
      <p>
        One talent that I have, however, I haven't developed as much, is
        acting. I have participated in some school plays, the last one I
        participated in was in late 2019 in high school (before the pandemic),
        called “PregonG19”, in which various pop culture characters appeared
        together in a fight of the good-bad , to find the "Secret of
        Perfection".
      </p>
      <img src="/images/Character.jpg" />
      <p>
        The protagonist was Saint Teresa of Ávila, in this work different
        stages of her life were covered, in which Dr. Strange, Mary Poppins,
        The Powerpuff Girls, Shrek, Indiana Jones, etc. appeared. And in my
        case, I was the Phantom of the Opera.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/Scene.png" />
      <p>
        In this case, I was the only character on stage in the immediate stage
        after the protagonist passed away, giving a monologue about how the
        most important thing that defines a person is not what they have, but
        what they do. and how was the legacy that she left due to her actions
        in life.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have also acted in Hamlet's "To be, or not to be" monologue, I acted
        as a psychologist in a project for Semana Tec at the university, as
        Agustín de Iturbide in a play about the Independence of Mexico, and I
        have also been a narrator of various school videos and host of events
        (although this is not acting as such, many of the fundamentals apply).
