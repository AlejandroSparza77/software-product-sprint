        One talent that I have, however, I haven't developed as much, is
        acting. I have participated in some school plays, the last one I
        participated in was in late 2019 in high school (before the pandemic),
        called “PregonG19”, in which various pop culture characters appeared
        together in a fight of the good-bad , to find the "Secret of
        Perfection".

        The protagonist was Saint Teresa of Ávila, in this work different
        stages of her life were covered, in which Dr. Strange, Mary Poppins,
        The Powerpuff Girls, Shrek, Indiana Jones, etc. appeared. And in my
        case, I was the Phantom of the Opera.

        In this case, I was the only character on stage in the immediate stage
        after the protagonist passed away, giving a monologue about how the
        most important thing that defines a person is not what they have, but
        what they do. and how was the legacy that she left due to her actions
        in life.

        I have also acted in Hamlet's "To be, or not to be" monologue, I acted
        as a psychologist in a project for Semana Tec at the university, as
        Agustín de Iturbide in a play about the Independence of Mexico, and I
        have also been a narrator of various school videos and host of events
        (although this is not acting as such, many of the fundamentals apply).
