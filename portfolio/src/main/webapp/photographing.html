      <p>
        I enjoy photographing exotic animals such as peacocks and deer as
        there are many close to my home.

        Similarly, I like to shoot crazy weather like heavy rain, storms and
        sunsets (in my hometown they get really beautiful).

        I also like to photograph musical events that I attend, such as an
        orchestra playing a symphony.
